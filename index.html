    <h1 class="heading">Charlie's Reading Recommendations</h1>

    <p>Compiled below are my (Charlie's) thoughts on a number of the books that I (Charlie) have read. 
        If you have similar taste to me you may find this list helpful in finding your next book.
        Even if you don't, you may find the rating system interesting. It takes into account three categories:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>Style</li>
        <li>Story</li>
        <li>Soul</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Style</h2>
    <p>
        This is the author's craft. The precision and viscerality of the diction and syntax used are rated under this category. 
        The most important component is how this writing style fits the narrative.
    </p>
    <h2>Story</h2>
    <p>
        This is the plot. The engagement and pull coming from the events of the story are rated under this category.
        Even seemingly mundane plots can grow into the most compelling.
    </p>
    <h2>Soul</h2>
    <p>
        This is the most abstract quality of the work: It is how the story's overall structure and devices synthesize with one another to leave a tremendous impact.
        It is what stays with the reader after they have turned the last page.
    </p>
